# spaCy_task
*Two tasks for my coding bootcamp 

1. The first uses a spaCy model with pre-trained word vectors to demonstrate similarities between words in a string
2. The second sets up an empty dictionary and reads a separate file, filling the dictionary with key (name of film) and value (description of film). It takes a description of a film as a parameter and by using NLP in spaCy it returns a recommended film based on which is most similar.
